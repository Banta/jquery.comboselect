JQuery.comboselect
==================
This is a port and a rehabilitation of the [JQuery.comboselect](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/comboselect).

What's it do?
-------------
The plugin transforms a multi-select from a single element to side by side multi-selects. You can move selections from one select to another instead of highlighting them in single.  Look at the example. This will make a lot more sense, I assure you.

Usage
-----
`$(#my_multi_select_box).comboselect({
        [options]
});


### Options
Stay tuned.
